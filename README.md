# ROR_Assignment
 This project is a React-based Store Rating Application that allows users to browse through a list of stores, view store details such as name, address, and average rating, and submit their own ratings. The interface is designed with a modern and responsive UI using CSS and features store images, a clean card layout, and a star rating system. Users can rate each store, and the application dynamically updates the ratings for a seamless user experience. This project is ideal for building a store review platform with a visually appealing, user-friendly design.
